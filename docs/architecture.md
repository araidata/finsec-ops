# Architecture

## Current State

Phase 0 is a static foundation. It defines the app shell, design language,
documentation structure, and test tooling.

## Target Separation

- UI: route shells and reusable visual components
- Services: domain workflows and business rules
- Providers: external integrations behind interchangeable boundaries
- Database: Prisma and PostgreSQL persistence after model review
- Utilities: small shared helpers

## Current UI Boundary

`src/components/dashboard` contains the static visual shell. Static sample data
lives in `src/lib/dashboard-data.ts` so the layout can be replaced with real
services later without mixing workflow logic into components.

## Provider Portability

Vercel and Neon are the initial platform choices. Future providers should be
isolated so the application can later move to internal AWS infrastructure with
PostgreSQL and Amazon Bedrock if required.
